# QueryEcho
AppleScript to automate execution of sql queries in pgAdmin. Script written in response to a rather unreasonable demand of running 50 SQL queries and manually screenshotting every single one.

Usage

1. Set Up SQL Commands File: Prepare a file containing the SQL commands you want to execute (e.g. queries.sql).
2. Configure Script: Adjust the script variables such as sqlFilePath and screenshotPath to match your file paths.
3. Run the Script: Executing the AppleScript automates the execution of each SQL query in pgAdmin and captures a screenshot.

Hope this script makes your life a bit easier
